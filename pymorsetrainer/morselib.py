    Morse code consists of "dits" (short tones), "dahs" (long tones),
    and pauses with varying length.

    Dits and dahs are often expressed by the letters . (dot) and - (dash).

    The lengths are as follows:
    dit:         1 length
    dah:         3 lengths
    dit pause:   1 length    (seperates symbols)
    dah pause:   3 lengths   (seperates letters)
    space:       7 lengths   (seperates words)

    The length of a dit is defined by repeating the standard word "PARIS", and
    counting the number of possible repetitions per minute (words per minute,
    wpm)

    PARIS = .--. .- .-. .. ... (space)
        = 10 dits + 4 dahs + 9 dit pauses + 4 dah pauses + 1 space 
        = 10 * 1 + 4 * 3 + 9 * 1 + 4 * 3 + 1 * 7
        = 22 voiced intervals + 28 silent intervals
        = 50 intervals
    => 1 wpm = 50 dits per minute = 1.2 seconds per dit.

    For didactive reasons, there is a second measure called "effective WPM"
    which lengthens the pauses between letters and words, but not between symbols.

    This so-called Farnsworth timing uses formulae defined as in
    http://www.arrl.org/files/file/Technology/x9004008.pdf
